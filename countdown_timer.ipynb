    "This code creates a countdown timer in Python. Let me explain it step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We import the `time` module, which helps with time-related operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We define a function called `countdown_timer` that takes hours and minutes as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the function, we calculate the total time in seconds by converting hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds) and minutes to seconds (1 minute = 60 seconds). We store this in `total_seconds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We print a message to indicate that the countdown timer has started with the given hours and minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We enter a `while` loop that continues as long as there are remaining seconds (`total_seconds > 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Inside the loop, we use `divmod` to convert `total_seconds` into minutes and seconds, and we format them to have leading zeros, like \"02:45\". This formatted time is stored in the `timeformat` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We print the `timeformat` on the same line to continuously display the remaining time.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. We use `time.sleep(1)` to pause the program for 1 second in each iteration. This creates a real-time countdown effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We decrement `total_seconds` by 1 in each iteration to keep track of the remaining time.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Once `total_seconds` reaches 0, the loop exits, and we print \"Countdown timer completed!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this code to create a countdown timer by entering the desired hours and minutes. The timer will update every second until it reaches 0, indicating that the countdown is complete."
